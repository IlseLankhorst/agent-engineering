    "The first take-home project will be a chance to get some hands-on practice with the concepts of Week 1 for an agent task of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a task involving multi-turn interaction/tool use\n",
    "- Implement an agent scaffold either using an API directly, or one of the frameworks we covered\n",
    "- Create a small set of \"test prompts\"\n",
    "- Create a \"reward function\" to evaluate your agent\n",
    "- Test your agent setup with multiple models/prompts\n",
    "- Examine multiple agent outputs, identify a consistent \"problem\", adjust the setup (prompts/tools) OR adjust your evals to measure/address the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas for agent tasks:\n",
    "- Search agent for your favorite blog/website\n",
    "- Agent which\n",
    "- Agent for playing a simple board/card game\n",
    "- Code agent specialized to only use a specific library, e.g. iterating on a matplotlib plot until it \"looks right\"\n",
    "- Terminal-based chat agent with user handoff/confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas for reward functions:\n",
    "- Format checks using regex\n",
    "- Deterministic checks (parsing math answers, running code with test cases, solving a puzzle/game)\n",
    "- Embedding or text overlap similarity to a \"ground truth\"\n",
    "- LLM judges which can see the \"ground truth\"\n",
    "- LLM judges which evaluate a set of fuzzy criteria + give scores for each\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- Start simple, get a basic version working, then ramp up complexity\n",
    "- If your agent \"just works\" with a fairly powerful model, try it with a weaker model and see what breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus goals:\n",
    "- Try making a \"parallel-friendly\" version using asyncio + error handling\n",
    "- Try implementing Best-of-N selection -- can your eval function match your judgment for which outputs are \"best\"?\n",
    "- Try testing either a \"multi-agent\" (parallelized) version of your agent, OR a Client/Server version (e.g. MCP, A2A)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverable:\n",
    "- A repo, notebook, *or* short writeup detailing your setup + experimentation\n",
    "- What approaches did you try?\n",
    "- What roadblocks did you run into?\n",
    "- Which evaluation methods worked best for your task?\n",
    "- What's the smallest model that worked decently well?"
